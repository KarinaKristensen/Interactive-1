  <h1> It had all started with 9/11. </h1> <br>

  <h2> I was in Toronto, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit. </h2> <br>

  <h3> We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center. </h3> <br>

  <h4> I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across blogs. </h4> <br>

  <h5> Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well. </h5> <br>

  <h6> So, using Notepad on Windows, I started experimenting. </h6> <br>

  <h5> Soon I ended up writing on hoder.com, using Blogger’s publishing platform before Google bought it.</h5> <br>

  <h4> Then, on November 5, 2001, I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog. </h4> <br>

  <h3> That sparked something that was later called a blogging revolution: </h3> <br>

  <h2> Soon, hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.</h2> <br>

  <h1> Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in Persian and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the list. </h1> <br>

  <h2> That’s why they called me “the blogfather” in my mid-twenties — it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared. </h2> <br>

  <h3> Every morning, from my small apartment in downtown Toronto, I opened my computer and took care of the new blogs, helping them gain exposure and audience. </h3> <br>

  <h4> It was a diverse crowd — from exiled authors and journalists, female diarists, and technology experts, to local journalists, politicians, clerics, and war veterans — and I always encouraged even more. </h4> <br>

  <h5> I invited more religious, and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, people who lived inside Iran, to join and start writing. </h5> <br>

  <h6> The breadth of what was available those days amazed us all.</h6> <br>

  <h5> It was partly why I promoted blogging so seriously. </h5> <br>

  <h4> I’d left Iran in late 2000 to experience living in the West, and was scared that I was missing all the rapidly emerging trends at home. </h4> <br>

  <h3>But reading Iranian blogs in Toronto was the closest experience I could have to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran and listening to collective conversations between the talkative driver and random passengers.</h3> <br>
