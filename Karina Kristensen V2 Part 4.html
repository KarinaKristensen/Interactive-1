It had all started with <center> 9 <br> / <br> 11. </center> <br>
  I was in Toronto, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit. We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the <center> <br> World <br> Trade <br> Center.</center> <br>
  I was &nbsp;&nbsp;p&nbsp;u&nbsp;z&nbsp;z&nbsp;l&nbsp;e&nbsp;d&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;c&nbsp;o&nbsp;n&nbsp;f&nbsp;u&nbsp;s&nbsp;e&nbsp;d&nbsp;&nbsp; and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across <center> <br> blogs. </center> Once I read a few, I thought: <br> <center> <em> This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well. </center> </em> <br>
   So, using Notepad on Windows, I started <br> <center> e&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g. </center> <br>
  Soon I ended up writing on <strong> <center> hoder.com,</center> </strong> <br> using Blogger’s publishing platform before Google bought it. <br>
  Then, on <br> <h2> <center> November 5, 2001, </center> </h2> I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog.
  That sparked something that was later called a <em> <center> <br> b &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;g r&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;v&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;u&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n:</em> </center> <br>
  Soon, <center> <h6>h<h5>u<h4>n<h3>d<h2>r<h2>e<h1>d<h1>s</h1> and <h6>t<h6>h<h5>o<h5>u<h4>s<h4>a<h3>n<h2>d<h1>s</h1> </center> <br> of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.
  Those days, I used to keep a <center> <br> l <br> i <br> s <br> t </center> <br> of all blogs in Persian and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the <center> <br> l <br> i <br> s <br> t. </center>
  That’s why they called me <h3> <center> <br> “the blogfather” </center> <br> </h3> in my <center> mid </center> -twenties — it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared. <br>
  Every morning, from my small apartment in <center> d <br> o <br> w <br> ntown </center> <br> Toronto, I opened my computer and took care of the new blogs, helping them gain exposure and audience. <br>
  It was a diverse crowd — <center> from exiled authors and journalists, <br> female diarists, <br> and technology experts, <br> to local journalists, <br> politicians, <br> clerics, <br> and war veterans <br> </center> <br>  — and I always encouraged even more. I invited more religious, and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, people who lived inside Iran, to join and <center> <br> start writing.</center> <br>
  The breadth of what was available those days amazed us all.
   It was partly why I promoted blogging so seriously. I’d left Iran in late 2000 to experience living in the <br> <br> West, <br> <br> and was scared that I was missing all the rapidly emerging trends at home. But reading Iranian blogs in Toronto was the closest experience I could have to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran and listening to collective conversations between the talkative driver and <center> <br> <h5>r<h2>a<h6>n<h3>d<h2>o<h4>m</h4> <br> </center> passengers.
