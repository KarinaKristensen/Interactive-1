      I was in Toronto. <br>
      The second plane hit.<br>
      I was puzzled.<br>
      Confused.<br>
      Looking for insights and explanations, I came across blogs.<br>


      Suddenly, it hit me:<br>

      This is it, I should start one.<br>

      So, I started experimenting.<br>


      November 5, 2001.<br>

      I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog.<br>

      That suddenly sparked a blogging revolution of which I became the leader.<br>

      The "blogfather."<br>

      Soon, hundreds and thousands of Iranians <br>made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs.<br>

      Every morning, from my small apartment in downtown Toronto, <br>I opened my computer and took care of the new blogs, <br>helping them gain exposure and audience.<br>

      It was a diverse crowd: <br>exiled authors and journalists, female diarists, <br>and technology experts, local journalists, <br>politicians, clerics, war veterans.<br>

      I invited more religious, <br>and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, <br>people who lived inside Iran, to join and start writing.<br>



      Iâ€™d left Iran late 2000 to experience living in the West.<br>

      I was scared that I was missing all the rapidly emerging trends at home.<br>

      Reading Iranian blogs in Toronto <br>was the closest experience I could have <br>to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran <br>and listening to collective conversations between <br>the talkative driver and random passengers.</span></p></div>
