  <p>Reading this, I felt like I was easily able to see myself signing up for something like it. And I have, in the past, stupidly signed up for FREE things without reading much about them. When the creator says that he finds it “heartbreaking to see that some of our users were upset to learn about how we monetize our free service” it makes me laugh. This idea is really just absurd, and to see that he takes this seriously is ridiculous. The idea of “good cop, bad cop” cited in this article could potentially be something I’d like to explore further.
Another idea in this article that I might like to explore is the idea of paying with privacy, or privacy as a currency.
Privacy as a luxury good is something almost crazy to think about.<br> </p>
<div class="p2">
  0. Good cop bad cop: what differentiates both of these? <br>
1. What if privacy was quite literally a luxury good? Something that only the most rich, wealthy people could afford it? <br>
2. What does it mean to pay with privacy?<br> <br></div>
<div class="p3">
  0… For this idea, I would split the page in half, constantly contrasting both ideas or both aspects of these groups of individuals. It would be fun to play with colors, but maybe switch them around so that it becomes confusing (and therefor random). To represent a change over time, including clocks could be something interesting to add, maybe a timer for how long you’ve been on the website and once you reach a certain amount of time, something happens… (not sure yet!)<br><br>
1… I’m thinking it might be interesting to use type as image in this case. The words could move across the page in a random order, as if there is some sort of exchange between both.<br><br>
2… This one would be more illustrative, maybe with animated eyes, multiple eyes that follow (or look away from) the cursor as one idea.
