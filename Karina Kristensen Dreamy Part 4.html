<h1>It all started with 9/11.<hr></h1></span></div>

  <div id="One">
    <p style="color:FloralWhite "><span style="font-size:20pt">  It had all started with 9/11.
      I was in Toronto, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit.
      We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center.
      I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across blogs.
      Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well.
      So, using Notepad on Windows, I started experimenting.</span></p></div>

  <div id="Two">
  <p style="color:LightSteelBlue"><span style="font-size:20pt">Soon I ended up writing on hoder.com, using Blogger’s publishing platform before Google bought it.
 Then, on November 5, 2001, I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog.
 That sparked something that was later called a blogging revolution:</span></p><br></div>

  <div id="Three">
      <p style="color:LightCyan "><span style="font-size:20pt">Soon, hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.
      Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in Persian and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the list.</span></sup></p><br></div>

  <div id="Four">
        <p style="color:LightSteelBlue"><span style="font-size:20pt">&nbsp;  That’s why they called me “the blogfather” in my mid-twenties — it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared.
          Every morning, from my small apartment in downtown Toronto, I opened my computer and took care of the new blogs, helping them gain exposure and audience.</span></p><br></div>

  <div id="Five">
        <p style="color:LightSteelBlue "><span style="font-size:20pt">It was a diverse crowd — from exiled authors and journalists, female diarists, and technology experts, to local journalists, politicians, clerics, and war veterans — and I always encouraged even more.
        I invited more religious, and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, people who lived inside Iran, to join and start writing.
      </span></p><br></div>

  <div id="Six">
        <p style="color:LightCyan "><span style="font-size:20pt"> The breadth of what was available those days amazed us all.
          It was partly why I promoted blogging so seriously.</span></p><br></div>

  <div id="Seven">
        <p style="color:FloralWhite "><span style="font-size:20pt"> I’d left Iran in late 2000 to experience living in the West, and was scared that I was missing all the rapidly emerging trends at home.
          But reading Iranian blogs in Toronto was the closest experience I could have to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran and listening to collective conversations between the talkative driver and random passengers.
